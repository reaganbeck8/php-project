## The purpose for this project was to create a quiz with php and demonstrate the use of loops to check/validate answers and tally a total of all the correct answers

## What knowledge was needed to create this project?

*Take a Look below*

> We were tasked to create a form and by using only loops for logic, we needed to check our answers. This was the first challenge within creating this project. I got around it by first plotting what was needed to be done and the logic behind it. Thus the use of:


1. PHP Multi-Dimensional Arrays

```
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.

PHP understands multidimensional arrays that are two, three, four, five, or more levels deep. 
However, arrays more than three levels deep are hard to manage for most people.

The dimension of an array indicates the number of indices you need to select an element.

    For a two-dimensional array you need two indices to select an element
    For a three-dimensional array you need three indices to select an element

```

2. PHP Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. 
You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

```
    if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
    if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
    
```
3. The PHP foreach Loop

The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.

```
For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array 
pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.

```
